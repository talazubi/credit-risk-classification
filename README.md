# credit-risk-classification
## Objective 
The following project successfully utilizes machine learning classification model to predict creditworthiness of borrowers. The model can categorise outcomes such as credit risk, or the potential of a loan default. This service can help corporations make informed, data driven decisions in aspects such as risk assessment.
## Performance Metrics 
* The Confusion Matrix illustrates that there are 18655 true negatives, and 583 true positives, 110 false positives and 36 false negatives.
* Accuracy: 95.8%. Accuracy is the ratio of correctly predicted instances (true positives and true negatives), to the total instances.
* Precision: 84.2%. Precision measures accuracy of positive predictions and is the ratio of true positives to total positives.
* Recall: 94.1%. Recall is the ability of the model to identify all instances of a positive class. Ratio of true positives to toal actual positives.

## Conclusion 
The logistics regression model predicts both the healthy loan '0' and high risk loan '1' labels extremely well. These results indicate a very high level of accuracy which demonstrates the model's effectiveness in classification and prediction. The following performance metrics justify my recommendation of this model for future corporations, as the high accuracy proves it to be successful.
